The Movie Recommendation App is a fun and interactive project designed to help users discover new movies based on their interests. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app offers a smooth user experience with an intuitive interface. Users can simply enter a movie name or select a genre, and the app will instantly suggest similar or trending movies. To get started, just download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. It's a great project for anyone looking to explore dynamic content rendering, work with APIs, or build something both useful and visually appealing. You can even enhance it by adding features like posters, ratings, or a watchlist for a more personalized touch.
